# MGAP4D — 4D Yang–Mills / genuine Wilson SU(2) Lean 4 formalization

**Original interacting Wilson theory · Gauss-law physical Hilbert space · Lean 4 + mathlib · Hidetoshi Itakura**

> **Research status, 2026-10-22 JST:** Genuine original-Wilson spatial GI response and its finite-volume physical Gram were quantified through MK; the full temporal Gaussian signed kernel analysis was completed through OC. OD gives the exact original two-posterior density-contrast functional and its equality on genuine FF Gauss-law physical receiver fibers. **OE** transfers LO–MK positive local/mean frame estimates to two true signed posterior receivers for real Gauss-law sources, including the **same plaquette-independent physical unit U**. **OF** identifies the literal arbitrary-depth right-Krylov zero-selector physical source with U even for nonnegative fine coupling and transports the same finite-H GI density floor. **No general all-source positive-fine Krylov injectivity, volume-uniform U0, cross-scale endpoint source or continuum Yang–Mills mass gap is proved.**

**日本語要約：** 真正Wilson二posterior・Gauss-law物理源・Perron半密度を変更せず、空間GIのLM〜MK、時間Gaussian解析のNT〜OC、真正posterior密度差汎関数とFF物理受信器の厳密一致（OD）を形式化した。**OE**で実際の二文脈signed受信器へのLO〜MK強制性の輸送と、元の定数物理源Uに対する有限体積のQ_GI/N_H一次下界を証明。**OF**で任意有限right-Krylov深さ・任意非負fine couplingの零次選択源が同じUになるGX等式を用い、真正GI下界へ厳密に接続した。文脈選択と正の下界は依然H依存。全係数源の分離、同一cross-scale endpoint、U0、H1-C1/C2/C3、連続体4次元Yang–Mills質量ギャップは未解決。

The checkpoint is deliberately **a dated theorem-bearing merge**, not a claim that the branch HEAD cannot advance when these documents or subsequent theorems merge. A documentation-only commit does **not** prove new mathematics. Order of evidence: **fresh authoritative HEAD → exact Lean declarations and their imports → CI at the exact source SHA and `#print axioms` → README/ROADMAP → historical discussions**. The repository's default `main` is **not** the theorem carrier.

## 2. Actual model: do not conflate these objects

1. **Original physical Wilson model.** The genuine interacting SU(2) spatial Wilson action, one-slab kernel, normalized joint ground-state/Perron transfer, and Gauss-law-invariant physical Haar-`L²` sources. Frozen `b = β_n` and fine `t = β_{n+1}` are distinct couplings.
2. **Two actual interacting posterior laws.** `p_{0,b}` and `p_{π,b}` are not independent Haar laws. SU(2) Haar is a reference measure for the actual densities, and pair-Haar integrations over genuine full boundary contexts are another operation.
3. **Actual signed source response.** `G_{H,b,e,z}(f)` is the original signed expectation/physical response of the true receiver under those two interacting posteriors. It retains joint half-density, transfer normalization and physical link insertion.
4. **Different operators and proof gates.** The original unnormalized Wilson Haar-reference `A_W`, normalized physical conditional-projection Dirichlet operator `D₁₂`, original signed GL/GI detector, finite-dimensional physical source Gram, and limiting physical time evolution are **different mathematical objects**. Restricted finite-volume positivity of one does not provide an absolute continuum mass gap for another.

In particular, **two different quantities historically called `Q` must be kept distinct**:

- `Q_post(b,e,z) = ∫(p_{0,b}-p_{π,b})² dν`: a *posterior density-contrast* norm in the earlier genuine GI bound.
- `Q_GI(H,b,e,e',z,z') = Σ_{p∈P_H} d_p²`: the *transfer-compensated original local GI-minor square energy* of LY onward. `Q_GI` in the equations below **never** denotes posterior contrast.

The compensation is purely scalar, not a change of physical law:
`d_p = ||T_{H,b}||² Δ_p`, where `Δ_p` is the actual original two-context local Wilson GI determinant. Its true underlying physical source remains `xU+yW_{H,p}U`.

## 3. What is proved: authentic Wilson source detection

The original **spatial** static two-context Wilson determinant is
$$
\Delta_W(z,z')=G_{e,z}(1)\,G_{e',z'}(W_H)-G_{e,z}(W_H)\,G_{e',z'}(1).
$$

- [JI–JK, #5656–#5657](https://github.com/itakura-hidetoshi/4d-mass-gap/pull/5657): actual spatial minor definition, anchored centering, exact Haar-moment obstruction, and original fine-coupling derivative `M'_0=-Δ_W/2`.
- **[LM, original nonzero two-context minor](MGAP4D/MathlibAnalytic/PhysicalYangMillsWilsonSU2ThreeModeKrylovAdjacentPairHaarOriginalTwoContextSpatialGIMinorNonzeroV5_LM.lean)**: for every fixed finite H, **b>0**, pair of actual physical links and prescribed initial boundaries, **some two genuine original interacting-Wilson contexts** yield `Δ_W≠0`. The former README/ROADMAP statement “original spatial nonzero GI minor OPEN” is **obsolete**. See `p4Q2LM_originalSpatialWilsonGIMinor_exists_nonzero_contexts`.
- **[LN–LP, true physical and local witness](MGAP4D/MathlibAnalytic/PhysicalYangMillsWilsonSU2ThreeModeKrylovAdjacentPairHaarOriginalLocalPlaquetteGIWitnessV5_LO.lean)**: original constant-unit and Wilson spatial physical source planes, genuine local-plaquette GI minors, quantitative original physical two-source Frobenius coercivity and a real plaquette witness.
- [LS–LX, genuine transfer/Harnack estimates](MGAP4D/MathlibAnalytic/PhysicalYangMillsWilsonSU2ThreeModeKrylovAdjacentPairHaarOriginalTransferNormalizationCompensatedCoercivityV5_LW.lean): original posterior/receiver norm, physical one-link joint-density Harnack and contrast envelope. The positive original contrast scale is
  $$
  E_b=e^{8b}(e^{16b}-e^{-16b})>0 \quad(b>0).
  $$
  Bounds on the compensated receiver are volume-independent *at fixed b*, but the resulting positive **coercivity floor** is not thereby uniform in H.

LM **closes the finite-volume spatial nonzero witness**, *not* all higher-Krylov source injectivity or continuum dynamics. A conditional small-positive-fine derivative consequence has to preserve its specific context, fine-coupling window and source; it does not extend automatically to all depths.

## 4. Quantitative genuine GI energy and physical spatial frame (LY–MK)

Fix a genuine finite H, `b>0`, physical links `e,e'`, and actual interacting-Wilson contexts `z,z'`. Define

$$
N_H=|\mathcal P_H|,\qquad
Q_{\rm GI}=\sum_{p\in\mathcal P_H}d_p^2,\qquad
k_{H,b}=\frac{Q_{\rm GI}/N_H}{10E_b^2}.
$$

These are computed from the **original finite plaquette carrier** and the **original two posterior GI determinants**. Let

$$
R_p(x,y)=G_{e,z}(xU+yW_{H,p}U)^2+
           G_{e',z'}(xU+yW_{H,p}U)^2.
$$

The true source is **p-dependent**: an average of these responses is not a single p-independent endpoint source.

| **[MK #5740](https://github.com/itakura-hidetoshi/4d-mass-gap/pull/5740)** | Separate reusable theorems selecting **one actual p** with `d_p²≥Q_GI/N_H`, genuine `κ_p≥k` and `k(x²+y²)≤R_p(x,y)` for all real x,y at the same genuine contexts; refines/organizes LY's existing maximum-witness result, without a new physical assumption. |

Two particularly useful **already checked** finite-H inequalities are
$$
\boxed{\quad
k_{H,b}(x^2+y^2)\leq
\frac{1}{N_H}\sum_{p\in\mathcal P_H}R_p(x,y),\qquad
\exists p\in\mathcal P_H:\ k_{H,b}(x^2+y^2)\leq R_p(x,y).
\quad}
$$
When genuine `Q_GI>0`, `k_{H,b}>0`. The existential plaquette/witness may depend on H, b and the original contexts.

For the **same actual spatial response**, set
$$
A=\tfrac1{N_H}\sum_pR_p(1,0),\quad
C=\tfrac1{N_H}\sum_pR_p(0,1),\quad
B=\tfrac1{2N_H}\sum_p[R_p(1,1)-R_p(1,0)-R_p(0,1)].
$$
Then the exactly polarized original spatial Gram `G=[[A,B],[B,C]]` satisfies
$$
\frac1{N_H}\sum_pR_p(x,y)=Ax^2+2Bxy+Cy^2,\qquad
G\succeq k_{H,b}I,\qquad
AC-B^2\geq k_{H,b}A\geq k_{H,b}^2>0.
$$
MI/MJ give a **fixed-context inverse** with
$$
G^{-1}(s,t)=
\left(\frac{Cs-Bt}{AC-B^2},\,\frac{At-Bs}{AC-B^2}\right),\qquad
k_{H,b}^{\,2}\|G^{-1}v-G^{-1}w\|_2^2\leq\|v-w\|_2^2.
$$

**Critical interpretation:** this is an original Wilson **spatial two-coordinate response frame**, with original `p`-dependent physical sources. It does **not** prove invertibility of the full physical transfer operator or positivity for all original physical Krylov sources; it is not a one-source endpoint theorem.

## 5. Original SU(2) Wilson Gaussian, physical GI receiver and zero-selector: NT–OF

For the **unchanged original SU(2) temporal Wilson section** on true holonomies `x,g ∈ SU(2)`, with the already-proved real-eight feature `J`,

$
K_b(x,g)=\exp(b\chi(x^{-1}g))
=e^b\exp\bigl(-\tfrac b4\|J(x)-J(g)\|^2\bigr),\qquad b>0.

| [NT–NX, #5776–#5780](https://github.com/itakura-hidetoshi/4d-mass-gap/pull/5780) | Genuine signed Wilson–Perron coordinate moments, all-degree character Gram expansion, finite double-action energy identities, bounded Banach double signed functional and convergent exponential. |
| **[NY #5781](MGAP4D/MathlibAnalytic/PhysicalYangMillsWilsonSU2ThreeModeKrylovAdjacentPairHaarOriginalSignedGaussianStrictV5_NY.lean)** | For **every** nonzero continuous real linear functional `L` on `C(SU(2),ℝ)`, the **complete** Gaussian double signed energy `T_L(K_b)>0` for all `b>0`. This specializes to strict positivity of the **original Wilson–Perron signed receiver's local Haar variance**; **not** to an arbitrary physical GI covariance. |
| **[NZ #5782](MGAP4D/MathlibAnalytic/PhysicalYangMillsWilsonSU2ThreeModeKrylovAdjacentPairHaarOriginalGaussianKernelSpanDenseV5_NZ.lean)** | By Hahn–Banach, `closure(span_ℝ {K_b(x,·) : x∈SU(2)}) = C(SU(2),ℝ)` for each fixed `b>0`; linear **span**, not merely a generated algebra. |
| **[OA #5783](MGAP4D/MathlibAnalytic/PhysicalYangMillsWilsonSU2ThreeModeKrylovAdjacentPairHaarOriginalGaussianAllFiniteStrictGramV5_OA.lean)** | For every finite *injective* family of genuine SU(2) holonomies and every nonzero real coefficient vector, `Σᵢⱼ aᵢ aⱼ K_b(xᵢ,xⱼ)>0`; finite point selectors establish nonzero signed evaluation, without rank assumptions. |
| **[OB #5784](MGAP4D/MathlibAnalytic/PhysicalYangMillsWilsonSU2ThreeModeKrylovAdjacentPairHaarOriginalGaussianMatrixPosDefV5_OB.lean)** | Literal original Gram is `Matrix.PosDef`, `IsUnit`, has nonzero determinant, and has `PosDef` inverse in the pinned mathlib. |
| **[OC #5785](MGAP4D/MathlibAnalytic/PhysicalYangMillsWilsonSU2ThreeModeKrylovAdjacentPairHaarOriginalGaussianFiniteInterpolationV5_OC.lean)** | At any finite set of distinct original SU(2) points and for any target vector `v`, coefficients `c=v ᵥ* M⁻¹` give `f(g)=Σⱼ cⱼK_b(xⱼ,g)` with **exactly** `f(xᵢ)=vᵢ`. Finite sections are linearly independent. |
| **[OD #5787](MGAP4D/MathlibAnalytic/PhysicalYangMillsWilsonSU2ThreeModeKrylovAdjacentPairHaarOriginalTwoPosteriorGaussianSeparationV5_OD.lean)** | The original two interacting Wilson posterior conditional density contrast `D=p₀−pπ` defines a **nonzero** real bounded signed functional `L_D(v)=∫v(g)D(g) dμ_Haar`. Its self-pairing is the **exact original** posterior squared Haar distance (GA/FX lower bound); NY gives positive complete signed Gaussian energy and an original Wilson temporal kernel section distinguishing the two posterior laws. **Exact original physical GI compatibility:** `Δ_GI(f;e,z) = L_{D(H,b,z.right,e)}(R_f(z,·))` for every actual Gauss-law physical Hilbert source `f`, with `R_f` the **unchanged FF signed receiver fiber**. Its general nonzero evaluation for physical `f` is NOT proved. |

| **[OE #5789](MGAP4D/MathlibAnalytic/PhysicalYangMillsWilsonSU2ThreeModeKrylovAdjacentPairHaarOriginalPhysicalSignedReceiverNonannihilationV5_OE.lean)** | Exact original FF receiver two-row signed functional square equals the genuine MD physical GI square on the same Gauss-law source xU+yW_pU. The previously proved LO two-context minor gives a positive two-row coefficient frame; MF/MK original Q_GI/N_H floor transports without changing any posterior. At selected true contexts the constant physical unit U itself satisfies (Q_GI/N_H)/(10 E_b²) ≤ L_D(R_U)²+L_Dprime(R_U)²; U is p-independent. No context- or H-uniform positivity asserted. |
| **[OF #5790](MGAP4D/MathlibAnalytic/PhysicalYangMillsWilsonSU2ThreeModeKrylovAdjacentPairHaarOriginalKrylovZeroSelectorSignedDensityFloorV5_OF.lean)** | Actual all-finite-depth right-Krylov zero-selector at scale n has true physical source exactly U for every nonnegative fine coupling beta(n+1), by GX. Therefore the same selected-context physical U floor is transferred exactly into the true signed receiver representation of that genuine right-Krylov coefficient source. Fixed frozen beta(n)>0; selected contexts and Q_GI/N_H coefficient may vary in scale/volume. |

**Remaining obstruction after the verified OD–OF physical receiver transport.** The exact OD identity maps each genuine Gauss-law physical source receiver fiber to its actual two-posterior GI response. OE proves selected two-context finite-H nonannihilation and an original Q_GI/N_H coercivity floor on the physical (U,W_pU) plane and on the same actual U; OF makes U the literal fine-right zero-selector source for every r. However a positive result on the zero-selector does **not** imply detector injectivity on all Krylov coefficients, nor that Q_GI/N_H admits a uniform H-dependent scale-independent lower bound, nor cross-scale endpoint or arbitrary-fine high-depth continuum transport. The Gaussian section density/finite interpolation still does not imply physical receiver range surjectivity.

Moreover, `M\succ0` for each finite point set does **not** provide a uniform lower bound on `λ_min(M)`, nor `inf_H Q_GI(H)/N_H>0`. OC's interpolation inverse may deteriorate with point geometry and H. These are separate, open quantitative gates.

## 6. Distinct earlier finite-volume results

- The original Wilson Haar-reference `A_W` and normalized physical Dirichlet `D₁₂` have distinct finite-volume Riesz/Loewner/restricted-spectrum results: [#5440](https://github.com/itakura-hidetoshi/4d-mass-gap/pull/5440), [#5472](https://github.com/itakura-hidetoshi/4d-mass-gap/pull/5472), [#5485](https://github.com/itakura-hidetoshi/4d-mass-gap/pull/5485).
- [#5514, ES–ET](https://github.com/itakura-hidetoshi/4d-mass-gap/pull/5514): the actual color count `L_c(H)=4(H+1)^3` and an H-dependent **relative** operator coefficient obstruction, not an absolute continuum-gap no-go.
- [#5574, GI–GL](https://github.com/itakura-hidetoshi/4d-mass-gap/pull/5574): original two-interacting-posterior signed physical response lower certificate with *the genuine `Q_post`* in its denominator. Never substitute `Q_GI` for this different quantity.
- [#5601–#5639, HI–IR](https://github.com/itakura-hidetoshi/4d-mass-gap/pull/5639): actual physical signed-source detectors, physical invisible subspace `I_phys=S(ker Φ)` and restricted visible quotient. Full signed-source positivity is conditional on eliminating this invisible sector. The zero-fine/all-depth and zero-depth/all-nonnegative-fine boundary cases are proved [#5621](https://github.com/itakura-hidetoshi/4d-mass-gap/pull/5621).
- [#5661–#5665, JO–JS](https://github.com/itakura-hidetoshi/4d-mass-gap/pull/5665): genuine temporal-Wilson posterior contrast detection, original physical receiver covariance remainder and a conditional receiver-span obstruction. They remain useful **separate** theorems; the once-open *spatial* nonzero-witness gate was subsequently closed by LM rather than by silently assuming receiver-span membership.

## 7. Explicitly OPEN — the actual continuum proof obligations

1. **Uniform authentic signed-source information.** Even though a witness with `Q_GI>0` exists at each finite H, **no** positive uniform lower bound for `Q_GI/N_H` across H/spacing/scales and physically compatible contexts is proved. `E_b` and the coupling schedule also require control.
2. **Full physical source coverage and endpoint transport.** Neither a p-dependent two-source Gram nor its stable inverse proves the required source separation for **arbitrary positive fine coupling and every Krylov depth**. The zero-invisible-sector condition and the transfer of actual local source estimates to the **same genuine endpoint physical source family** are open.
3. **Spatial/scale summability.** Genuine interacting-Wilson receiver covariance and spatial tails must have appropriate localization and summable, volume-compatible constants; no Dobrushin substitute or independent-Haar conditional model may be silently introduced.
4. **H1-C1/C2/C3 strong limit**, including genuine coarse/fine compatibility and a single natural-time physical operator; physical-time semigroup, OS/Wightman reconstruction and full nontrivial continuum **4D Yang–Mills mass gap** are subsequent, separate open gates.

No single fixed-volume rank/Gram witness, positive finite-lattice spectral band, or `sorry`-free theorem resolves those continuum obligations. See the precise **[ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)**.

## 8. Reproducing source and auditing proof integrity

Work from the **verified theorem-bearing OF checkpoint**, not default `main` or an unrelated docs-only SHA:

```bash
git fetch origin formal/real-hilbert-uniform-coercive-strong-limit
git switch --detach 94b327814a724264772dcc7bf8f2d749ed1091aa
cat lean-toolchain
# Optional when a compatible pinned cache is available:
lake exe cache get
# Dependency-aware build of the exact latest theorem-bearing leaf:
lake build MGAP4D.MathlibAnalytic.PhysicalYangMillsWilsonSU2ThreeModeKrylovAdjacentPairHaarOriginalKrylovZeroSelectorSignedDensityFloorV5_OF
# Full repository build is a separate, more expensive check:
# lake build
```

The OF file has four `#print axioms` reports checked in exact-head CI #39720662153 (no `sorryAx`). Two theorems depend on standard `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` only; the two coercivity/witness consequences inherit five previously known finite-lattice `native_decide` axioms. **No new unproved axiom was added.** This is a theorem-bearing checkpoint and is distinct from the later docs-only HEAD.

For a future theorem: inspect current canonical SHA, the **complete Lean file and its physical prerequisites**, the exact changed-source-head CI and public axioms; fix errors/warnings in changed files, verify the independent MCP CI completion receipt, then merge and re-observe the new canonical SHA. The PR Lean Fast Check workflow is path-filtered to Lean sources, configuration, and scripts; a README/ROADMAP-only PR does **not** trigger the Lean workflow. Review Markdown and source links directly instead of rebuilding thousands of unchanged theorem modules.
