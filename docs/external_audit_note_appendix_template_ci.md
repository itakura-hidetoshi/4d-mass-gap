Boundary:

```text
This CI confirmation records a documentation-only external audit note appendix template update.
It does not claim R1--R7 theorem completion.
It does not unlock final gap theorem release.
It does not introduce Mathlib into main.
It preserves the public theorem boundary pending independent replay and external audit.
```
