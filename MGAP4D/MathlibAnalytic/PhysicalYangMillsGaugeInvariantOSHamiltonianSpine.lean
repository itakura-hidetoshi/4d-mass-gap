# Physical gauge-invariant OS Hamiltonian spine

This aggregate module exposes the completed analytic route

```text
positive-time observable algebra
→ physical contraction semigroup
→ strong continuity
→ right infinitesimal generator
→ right Hamiltonian
→ semigroup covariance
→ Bochner time averages
→ dense generator domain
→ nonnegative Hamiltonian form
→ finite-time Laplace resolvent identity
→ positive-shift surjectivity and bijectivity
→ maximal-accretive package
→ formal symmetry implies self-adjointness
→ conditional reflection/time-translation exchange
→ completed semigroup inner-product symmetry
→ right generator and Hamiltonian formal symmetry
→ graph-closed Hamiltonian formal symmetry
→ conditional closed Hamiltonian self-adjointness
→ real Yin-Yang Schrödinger algebra bridge
```

The terminal self-adjointness theorem remains conditional on the observable-side
Osterwalder--Schrader reflection/time-translation exchange identity.  This module
does not assert that identity, a real-time unitary group, vacuum uniqueness, or a
positive spectral gap.
