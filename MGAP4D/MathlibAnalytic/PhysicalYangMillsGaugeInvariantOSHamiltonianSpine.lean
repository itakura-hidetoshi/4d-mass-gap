The terminal self-adjointness theorem remains conditional on a configuration-space
Euclidean-time action preserving every approximating law, a compatible reflection,
positive-time restriction, and identification of the OS state with the continuum
expectation state.  Continuum time-translation invariance itself is now derived
from weak convergence.  This module does not construct the finite-lattice time
translations or their compatibility with the physical interpolation, a real-time
unitary group, vacuum uniqueness, or a positive spectral gap.
